Question 2

No


Question 3
----------
[For each term create 3 fields.]

term URI: http://schema.org/Article
candidates: http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Article, http://schema.org/Article, http://sw-portal.deri.org/ontologies/swportal#Article, http://guava.iis.sinica.edu.tw/r4r/Article, http://lsdis.cs.uga.edu/projects/semdis/opus#Article
why: Some pages like http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Article downloaded a .php file, others like http://lsdis.cs.uga.edu/projects/semdis/opus#Article served an xml file, which was very confusing. http://schema.org/Article as well as http://guava.iis.sinica.edu.tw/r4r/Article were nicely structured. http://schema.org/Article is my favorite in this case since the data is presented in a nice way.

term URI: http://schema.org/author
candidates: http://lsdis.cs.uga.edu/projects/semdis/opus#author, http://schema.org/author, http://d-nb.info/standards/elementset/gnd#author
why: One page (http://lsdis.cs.uga.edu/projects/semdis/opus#author) did only present some xml data. http://d-nb.info/standards/elementset/gnd#author did represent data in a table but was quite confusing to use. http://schema.org/author is my favorite. As in previous examples the data is just represented in a better way than the alternatives.

term URI: http://schema.org/Person
candidates: http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person, http://ns.nature.com/terms/Person, http://schema.org/Person
why: On http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person there was a huge wall of text. I didn't find the information I was looking for right away. http://ns.nature.com/terms/Person is a plain xml page. Not really user-friendly. http://schema.org/Person is my favorite in this case since the data is presented in a nice way.
